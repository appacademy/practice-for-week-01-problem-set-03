# Problem Set 03

These problems are to challenge your knowledge in working with arrays and
strings, including manipulating values and utilizing a range of built in
methods.

## Setup

1. Download this practice from GitHub.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `mocha` to run all specs.

## Instructions

Your goal is to solve each problem so that all specs are passing.

These problems entail the following challenges as the primary objectives:

- `doubler()`: determining values of a new array based on an input array.
- `fibonacciSequence()`: determining values of a new array based on a famous
sequence.
- `rotateRight()`: manipulating array values with built in array methods.
- `removeEWords()`: manipulating strings and arrays with built in methods.
- `alternatingWords()`: manipulating strings and arrays with built in methods
in a more complex scenario.

For additional tests that may help with debugging you can comment in
`console.log()` statements in each file, then run
`node <problem-relative-file-path>` in your terminal. For example,
`node problems/01-doubler.js`

You can run tests for specific problems with `mocha test/<problem-spec-file>`.
For example, `mocha test/01-doubler-spec.js`

## Submission

Once all of your specs are passing, prepare your work for submission:

1. Delete the __/node_modules__ folder.
2. Zip up the entire folder including code and specs.
3. Submit your zipped file.
